. 🧠 Enhance the AI Generator
I noticed in 
src/index.ts
 that you are using deepseek-coder:6.7b as the default model. You could:

Add a System Prompt: Refine the prompt sent to Ollama in 
src/llm/ollamaEnhancer.ts
 to ensure it always follows Conventional Commits.
Local Model Detection: Add a feature that checks which models the user has available in Ollama (ollama list) and suggests the best one.
3. 🎨 Build the Frontend Dashboard
Your frontend/ directory has a Next.js app, but it seems separate from the CLI. You could:

Commit History Visualizer: Make the frontend read the local git history and display AI-generated summaries of past work.
Web-based Configurator: Create a UI to manage .gitbunrc settings visually.
4. 🧪 Expand Test Coverage
Since we just set up Vitest, you could add tests for:

typeClassifier.ts
: Ensure it correctly identifies feat, fix, etc., based on file changes.
commitGenerator.ts: Ensure the string formatting is correct.
